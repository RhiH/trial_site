# trial_site
A site for developing ideas and testing out elements.

Logic

Having finished my coding course with Code Institute I wanted to practice ideas and concepts with no pressure on myself - a project I can pick up and put down as and when - working on small elements over time to icrease my knowledge and understanding - problem solving!

I want to build a site to showcase my own art and textiles - but I believe testing out a site first will help me to build a better site - learn how to fix problems before I encounter them on a bigger project.

Ideas

Create an aesthetically pleasing site - while testing our different concepts and options to push my knowledgebase further. Make copious cheat sheets and notes of the basic things that I've previously learned but have forgotten!

Concept

Use own images to create a site that works well and see how the site develops - will it solely be a testing site or will there be a final finished project stage? The site is a journey and a journal - not only in how my own skills develop - but also how I decide what works and what doesn't for a finished 'look'. 

UI

To create an aesthetically pleasing site with navigation - and develop as it progresses.
